This project explores 4 years of retail sales data to identify where and why profit margins are eroding — and how pricing strategy changes could improve profitability. Built end-to-end using PostgreSQL (SQL) and Power BI (DirectQuery), it integrates data modeling and visualisation, with scenario simulation, into an interactive executive dashboard.
