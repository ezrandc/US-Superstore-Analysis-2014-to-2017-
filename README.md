# US Superstore Analysis (2014 to 2017)

**Executive Summary**

This project analyses the US Superstore dataset (Kaggle) containing four years of transactional sales data (2014–2017) across products, customers, cities, and discount structures.
Using PostgreSQL (SQL) for data preparation and Power BI (DirectQuery) for reporting, the goal was to uncover what drives profitability, particularly the impact of discounting behavior, with a simplified model on how changes in pricing strategy could improve performance.

The analysis was driven by four key business questions:

1. Where is the company losing profit?
2. Why are margins particularly low in certain categories and cities?
3. Do discounts actually drive higher sales?
4. What would happen if discounting were capped?

Two interactive dashboard pages were built to answer these questions:

Page 1: Business Performance Overview

Page 2: Profit Analysis & Discount Impact

The insights were shaped by an SQL-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), ensuring a rigorous analytical foundation.
